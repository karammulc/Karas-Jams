Hello! This project is especially personal and meaningful to me. Throughout my life and it's complexities music has offered solice and opportunities for connection. 
Instead of adressing a business problem; this project will be an exploration of my own spotify data and personal patterns. 

Objectives: 
- Explore the patterns within my relationship to music
- Attempt new techniques
- Get to know myself better

I hope this offers the opportunity for you to get to know me better aswell. Lets go!
