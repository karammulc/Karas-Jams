## Introduction

# StreamTunes-Case-Study
Hello! This project is especially personal and meaningful to me. Throughout my life and its complexities, music has offered solace and opportunities for connection. 
Instead of addressing a business problem, this project will explore my Spotify data and personal listening patterns. 

Objectives: 
- Explore the patterns within my relationship to music
- Play with new tools
- Offer the opportunity for you to get to know me better

Lets go!
